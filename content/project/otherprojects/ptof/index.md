### Introduction:
We explore a novel 3D imaging device leveraging real thermal light intensity interferometry, offering advancements in single-photon counting detectors, with potential applications in fields like LIDAR devices.

### Method:
#### Intensity Interferometry & SPAD Technology:
Our method utilizes the photon bunching signature of thermal light, allowing hardware-independent 3D imaging. We employ a new photon counting technique using synchronized single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) technology to enhance acquisition performance.

#### Thermal Light Source & Photon Distribution:
We use quasi-monochromatic light from a Sodium lamp, coupled into a fiber beam splitter for adequate coherence. This light is distributed into two interferometer arms, enabling precise measurement of photon correlations and creating a histogram of photon bunching events.

### Results and Discussion:
The system achieves a depth resolution of 1.7 mm and potentially sub-millimeter precision. It significantly improves acquisition time and is particularly sensitive for histogram events around the correlation peak, offering a robust and undetectable alternative to laser illumination.

### Conclusion:
This innovative approach in 3D imaging, utilizing intensity interferometry and real thermal light, opens up new possibilities in high-precision applications, presenting a promising, optimized alternative to conventional methods.
