### Introduction
We explore the intricate world of army ant bivouacs using a custom-built Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. These self-assembling structures, formed by interconnected ants, have been challenging to study due to their delicate nature, but our innovative approach has allowed for detailed internal investigations.

### Method
#### CT Scanner & Experimentation
We developed a specialized CT scanner and installed it in Panama, where we collected Eciton burchellii army ant colonies. The scanner helped observe the self-assembly process of bivouacs, creating 3D reconstructions to study their growth in volume and the number of ants.

### Results and Discussion
Our findings reveal that bivouacs are complex structures with a dense outer shell and a less dense interior. The load supported by individual ants is consistent throughout the bivouac, suggesting that the bivouac's size is not limited by the individual ants' load-supporting capacity but by the number of available ants. The bivouacs maintain distinguishable morphological regions and achieve an equal distribution of carried loads, circumventing upper size limits.

### Conclusion
This study has provided unprecedented insights into the growth and internal structure of army ant bivouacs, offering valuable inspiration for designing large-scale artificial self-assembling systems in various fields. The findings suggest a remarkable level of organization and adaptability in these constantly reconfiguring structures.
