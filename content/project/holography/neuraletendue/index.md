title: Neural Etendue Expansion
summary: Neural étendue expanders revolutionize augmented reality by drastically increasing the étendue of holographic displays, enabling ultrathin, wearable AR devices that produce stunning full-color holograms for complex scenes. This breakthrough overcomes the diffraction limits of current spatial light modulators, setting a new standard in virtual and augmented reality technology.
