In one my most favorite research projects that I have worked on, we propose a novel architecture for holographic displays called multisource holography, designed specifically to reduce speckle noise while maintaining high resolution and natural defocus cues. Traditional holographic displays rely on coherent illumination, which can create undesirable speckle patterns in the final image. Existing speckle reduction techniques often sacrifice resolution or require high-speed modulators and temporal multiplexing.

Multisource holography addresses these challenges by replacing the single coherent light source with a grid of multiple mutually incoherent sources. By using two spatial light modulators (SLMs) with a small air gap between them, the system breaks correlations between the sources, enabling each source to independently contribute to the final hologram. The intensities from the multiple sources sum incoherently at the image plane, effectively suppressing speckle through averaging.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through both simulations and a benchtop experimental prototype. In simulations, multisource holography achieves up to a 10 dB increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to an equivalent single source system. The experimental results showcase low speckle holograms for both 2D images and focal stacks with natural defocus blur. We also introduce a customized calibration procedure to account for non-idealities in the optical system.

Multisource holography represents a significant step forward in the development of practical, high-quality holographic displays for virtual and augmented reality applications. By enabling speckle reduction in a single frame without sacrificing resolution or requiring high-speed modulators, this innovative approach paves the way for more realistic and visually appealing holographic experiences.
