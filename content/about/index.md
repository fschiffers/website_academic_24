          Hi, I'm Florian. I am a skilled computer vision researcher specializing in AI-driven algorithms for computational imaging, 3D vision, and holographic displays. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. with [Prof. Oliver Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), focusing on computational display. 

          Throughout my Ph.D., I have been working closely with [Meta Reality Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs), collaborating with renowned researchers such as [Doug Lanman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-qncsGYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Nathan Matsuda](https://www.nathanmatsuda.com/), and [Grace Kuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxPNXcIAAAAJ&hl=en) to pioneer cutting-edge techniques for next-generation AR/VR displays. I have also had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Felix Heide](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ks3bdckAAAAJ&hl=en) from Princeton University on various projects related to holographic displays.

          My academic journey began at [Friedrich-Alexander Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg](https://www.fau.eu/), Germany, where I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in [Physics](https://www.physics.nat.fau.eu/), and an M.Sc.Hons in [Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.maot.studium.fau.de/). During my B.Sc., I worked on my thesis "[Calibration of multi-line triangulation 3D sensors](https://www.dgao-proceedings.de/download/115/115_p12.pdf)" under [Prof. Gerd Häusler](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=ZMoUIRUAAAAJ) and my good friend [Prof. Florian Willomitzer](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=XdCdz4oAAAAJ&hl=en), with whom I worked for a few years. For my M.Sc. thesis, I delved into [Computed Tomography in Talbot-Lau X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging](http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/fileadmin/research/Publikationen/2017/Schiffers17-PML.pdf), supervised by [Prof. Gisela Anton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisela_Anton), [Dr-Ing Christian Riess](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0HGXYNMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Andreas Maier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MA6SDuEAAAAJ&hl=en).

          In addition to my primary research focus, I have also worked closely with [Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c6AIvmUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Daniel Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dIqVCH8AAAAJ&hl=en) on AI applications for medical imaging, particularly for Cardiac MRI, as a side-hobby throughout my Ph.D.

          I had the opportunity to study abroad through the [Erasmus program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme) at [Universite de Bordeaux, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bordeaux), and [Universidad de Cantabria, Spain](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx), enriching my learning experience and cultural exposure. Transitioning to professional life, I contributed to a project in robotics for image-guided surgery at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/). Later, I explored machine learning applications in [Ophthalmology](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-56537-7_64) at [Peking University, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University) advised by [Prof. Qiushi Ren](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Qiushi-Ren).

          Throughout my academic career, I have published extensively in top-tier venues such as SIGGRAPH, ICCV, and ICCP. I have also developed open-source software tools that have been adopted by the research community, demonstrating my commitment to making an impact beyond my immediate work.

          As I continue with my Ph.D., I also enjoy teaching. I've been a [full instructor](/teaching) for several courses at Northwestern, and more details about my teaching experiences can be found on the [teaching tab](teaching).

          My ultimate goal is to continue driving innovation in the fields of computer vision, AI, and AR/VR as a research scientist in industry. With my strong technical background, interdisciplinary expertise, and proven track record of impactful research, I am well-positioned to develop groundbreaking imaging and display technologies that transform industries from healthcare to entertainment.

          When I'm not in the lab, you can find me exploring my hobbies, which include playing basketball, squash, and experimenting with computational photography techniques in the real world.

              I developed calibration algorithms for medical robotics aimed at enhancing computer-assisted spine surgery. I implemented a novel measurement pipeline in MATLAB, which accurately tracked the relative movement of multiple medical robots concerning a phantom patient's spine. This work significantly improved the precision and reliability of robotic-assisted surgical procedures.
              Collaborated with Philip Mewes and Thomas Pheiffer on deformable registration problems in minimally invasive surgery. Implemented and evaluated algorithms for medical image processing, registration, and segmentation.
